ShortComings:
Custom EntityActions should have Init method to use to initialize themselves like getting some components or other actions. Currently the initialization happens in construction before the whole entity is constructed.

Things like deleting and entity from collision handler should be scheduled and postponed and then processed in some defined order. That usually takes place during a frame where the gameplay logic might mark something as deleted but
all the deleted objects get processed at the end of the frame. Here I kind of simulate that a bit with weak_ptr but it quite weak (ehm) solution.
 - I eventually had to implement this because the shortcomings has come to fruition even in such a small scope
